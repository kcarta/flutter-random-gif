# random gif

Shows random gifs, using the Giphy API.

This was my first Flutter app, written over a few short train rides in early 2018. To get a taste of a simple Flutter app anno 2018, check out the code under lib/old-app.

To run, get an API key at developers.giphy.com - save this key in a file in the assets directory named api_key
